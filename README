Overview
===================
This project is a convenient mechanism of packaging the
hadoop-gpl-compression project from Google Code.

It has three basic steps:

1) Perform an svn export of the most recent revision of hadoop-gpl-compression
2) Create and build an RPM
3) Create an build a Debian package

Requirements:
====================

- subversion
- java (preferably sun's JDK)
- appropriate package building tools for your platform
  - yum install rpm-build        (RedHat based)
  - apt-get install dev-scripts  (Debian based)

When you try to build for your platform, build dependency errors will also
inform you of any other packages you may need to install (eg lzo2 devel
packages, ant, etc)

Usage:
====================
To build packages, simply run the included shell script.

  ./run.sh

We recommend you run this on the same platform as your tasktrackers so
as to be sure the built libraries are compatible.

If you would like to skip building debian or rpm, you can do:

  SKIP_RPM=1 ./run.sh
    or
  SKIP_DEB=1 ./run.sh

If you'd like to check out a particular revision, you can do:

  SVN_REV=46 ./run.sh

There are some other variables that can be overridden - simply look
at the top section of run.sh to learn what they are.

After running the script, you should be able to find debs in the build/deb
directory and RPMs in the build/topdir/RPMS directory.
